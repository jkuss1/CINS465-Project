# Sales Tracker

# Proposal
Create an application that keeps track of items purchased and sold.

This app will track:
* The name of the item
* The time period of the sales
* The cost of each item
* The sales price for each item (including discounts)
* The number of items purchased and in stock
* The number of items sold
* The number of items gone bad (if applicable)
* The overall profit from this.

The user would be able to add items and thus create more form fields for all of these. In addition to this, they can clear/save the information and store it on another page. For example, they can store sales data for the month of September and clear the forms for a fresh record in October. This page would contain all the data for each item, and the total sales/costs and profits for that month. Another page would have information such as the item that generated the most revenue, the item that generated the least revenue, the item that sold the most, and the item that sold the least.

In addition to this, the application would compare months and how well the company faired. Users would also be able to see what times of the year an item gains and dips in popularity and, if we can manage it, the effects of discounts on sales numbers and profits earned.

### Pages
